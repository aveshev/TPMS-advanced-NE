# TPMS-advanced-NE

> **NE = Nerd Edition.** A fork of [VincentMasselis/TPMS-advanced](https://github.com/VincentMasselis/TPMS-advanced). Playing around with Claude Code, adding features that won't necessarily make it into the main TPMS Advanced.

Android app for Bluetooth Low Energy TPMS sensors made by the manufacturers Sysgration and Pecham

Regular (non-NE) edition available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.masselis.tpmsadvanced)
I will put a compiled release of the NE edition here once it's deemed polished enough.

## What's new in the Nerd Edition

### Persistent scanning

An optional always-on mode for background monitoring. Instead of starting it by hand before
every ride, a foreground service keeps running, comes back after a reboot or an app update, and
decides by itself when to actually listen to the sensors, so battery is only spent when it is
useful.

* **Activate scan conditions**: charging with a cable, charging wirelessly, Android Auto
  connected. Optionally **stay active** for 1 to 30 minutes after the last one ends. Turning
  the conditions off means always scanning.
* **Suspend scan conditions**: they override the activate conditions. The phone being idle
  (screen off, not charging, no movement: Deep Doze), or connected to any WiFi, except the
  ones you list (car hotspot, garage WiFi, etc.)
* A **status bell** replaces the Start/Stop button: green when scanning, orange when suspended,
  neutral when idle, red when a permission is missing. Tap it to see why.
* Scanning while the app is open is never affected. With persistent scanning off, the manual
  Start/Stop button works as before.

Reading the WiFi name in the background needs location access "Allow all the time"; the app
walks you through it only if you use WiFi exceptions.

### Everything else

* Separate front and rear pressure targets
* Pressure and temperature thresholds typed in rather than set with sliders
* Sensor ID and time since the last update shown on each tyre, with an explanation of why some
  sensors stay silent for a long time
* Only the value that triggered an alert blinks
* Background monitoring covers all vehicles at once
* App settings styled like the Android settings app, each option explained on its own page
* Unrestricted battery usage requested before background monitoring starts, so the system
  doesn't kill it

## Features

* Pressures alerts
* Temperature alerts
* Support one or multiple cars
* QR Code scanning
* Dark mode
* Pressure and temperature units selection
* Show the latest recorded value even after a restart
